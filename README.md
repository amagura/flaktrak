# flaktrak
A time tracker for the command-line


## Notes

Flaktrak is currently written in python v3.5.  However, I fully intend to port it either completely to C or to C and an embedded language such as lua.
But as I actually intend to use Flaktrak at work, I need it (lol) working asap, hence the need for a language that supports fast protoyping and development
without many of the concerns that C adds; don't get me wrong, I love C, but I don't always have time for it.
